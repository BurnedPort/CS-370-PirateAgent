# CS-370: Artificial Intelligence – Pirate Intelligent Agent

## Project Overview
In this project, I implemented an intelligent agent capable of navigating a treasure map using reinforcement learning. The starter code provided the game environment, state definitions, and a simple training loop. I extended this foundation by creating my own **Q-learning algorithm**, tuning the reward function, and adjusting the exploration–exploitation balance so the agent could learn to locate the treasure efficiently.

## What I Learned
Throughout this course, I applied key concepts from **reinforcement learning and neural networks** to real-world-style problems. I learned how agents make sequential decisions, balance short-term versus long-term rewards, and improve performance through experience.

## Connection to Computer Science
Computer scientists design algorithms and systems that solve complex problems and improve everyday life. The pirate agent project demonstrates this by teaching a machine to learn through feedback rather than explicit instructions-mirroring how AI systems are applied in robotics, cybersecurity, and automation.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I start by **breaking it into smaller, testable components**, identifying data flows, and iterating through experiments to refine performance. This mindset encourages creativity while keeping solutions grounded in logic and evidence.

## Ethical Responsibilities
Ethics in AI means designing systems that are **transparent, fair, and beneficial**. As computer scientists, we must consider how algorithms impact users and organizations-avoiding bias, protecting privacy, and ensuring that intelligent systems enhance rather than harm. For this project, that mindset translated to writing clear, reproducible code and documenting every assumption.
